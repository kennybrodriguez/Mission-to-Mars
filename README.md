# Mission-to-Mars

### Overview
This project focused on extracting/scraping data from the Mars Planet Science website (https://data-class-mars.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html). The python script automates navigating the site and scraping the data using BeautifulSoup and Splinter. We took the scraped data and stored it using MongoDB. To display the results we used Flask. More specifically the Flask-PyMongo library to help link the data to the flask app. Lastly, we used Bootstrap CSS to help make the html mobile friendly and responsive.
